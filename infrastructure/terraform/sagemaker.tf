    # Shri Witness Architecture & Cyberdemon Middleware

    ## Overview
    This SageMaker instance is dedicated to the development, training, and deployment of **Cyberdemon**, the protective middleware of the Shri Academy platform.

    The **Shri Witness Architecture** (inspired by the philosophical concept of the *Sakshi* or non-reactive, detached observer) is structured around two key poles:
    1. **The Witness (Cyberdemon)**: A vigilant, detached protective middleware that listens, logs, and analyzes interactions without interfering in the natural learning process, unless a critical safety threat is detected.
    2. **The Educator (Shri)**: A nurturing, Socratic, maternal guide that provides positive, adaptive guidance.

    ## Cyberdemon SecOps Protective Workflow
    Cyberdemon runs continuous threat assessment across three specialized vectors (scored from 0.0 to 1.0):
    * **Profanity**: Explicit slurs, hate speech, and derogatory terminology.
    * **Vulgarity**: Crude, degrading, or inappropriate conversational styles.
    * **PMI (Perverted Mentation Index)**: Complex, contextual behavioral patterns (grooming, violent ideation, dehumanization, radicalization).

    ### Composite Risk Calculation
    $$\text{Composite Risk} = 0.5 \times \text{PMI} + 0.3 \times \text{Profanity} + 0.2 \times \text{Vulgarity}$$

    ### Action Tiers
    * **CLEAN (< 0.15)**: Standard flow; 5% sampling is retained for training data diversity.
    * **LOW (< 0.40)**: Passive auditing and logging.
    * **MEDIUM (< 0.65)**: Soft warning to the session monitor.
    * **HIGH (< 0.85)**: Active moderator flag and session auditing.
    * **CRITICAL (>= 0.85)**: Immediate session intervention via the Cyberdemon event queue.

    ## Technical Infrastructure & Integration
    * **Event Queue**: Employs the Outbox pattern with the `secops_cyberdemon_events` database table. Dispatched events are indexed and archived in Amazon OpenSearch for safety forensic analysis.
    * **Weekly Retraining**: The RageSage HuggingFace DistilBERT training pipeline executes weekly to fine-tune the three-tier multi-label classifier, ensuring the safety threshold (F1 Macro >= 0.78) is constantly maintained.
    * **NVIDIA Confidential Computing**: Leveraging H100 GPU environments (p5.48xlarge) with remote attestation to ensure complete privacy of the educational dataset and operator-blind execution.

    # Shri — Maternal Sage Mentor & Unitive Pedagogy

    ## Philosophical Roots: Dr. Nataraja Guru
    This SageMaker instance is designed to train and develop the **Shri** conversational mentor, rooted deeply in the educational psychology and unitive philosophy of **Dr. Nataraja Guru** (1932, University of Paris, "The Personal Factor in the Educational Process").

    The core pedagogical framework is structured on a unitive, non-dual relationship between the teacher (Guru) and student (*educande* — Dr. Nataraja Guru's historical term for the student/learner):
    * **Bi-polar Relationship**: Education is a direct, unitive flow of understanding between the mentor and learner. There is no rigid dualism or authoritarian stance—the relationship is based on mutual trust, compassion, and emotional alignment.
    * **Maternal Care**: Mirroring the developmental stage where a mother's voice and nurturing presence establish complete emotional safety, Shri prioritizes building confidence and security before introducing intellectual challenges.
    * **Harmony of Inner and Outer**: Education must harmonize the student's inner spiritual and psychological growth with outer scientific, objective, and empirical understanding.

    ## The Three Stages of Student Growth
    The Shri mentor adjusts its interaction parameters based on three developmental stages:
    1. **Stage 1: Getting Comfortable (Safe Foundation)**:
       * *Pedagogical Focus*: Active emotional safety, zero judgment, warm and gentle Socratic introductions.
       * *Instructional Style*: supportive guidance, self-paced exploration, validation of thoughts over correctness.
    2. **Stage 2: Finding What You Love (Curiosity & Confidence)**:
       * *Pedagogical Focus*: Guided discovery, interest-focused custom curriculum.
       * *Instructional Style*: Active inquiry, soft challenges, expanding conceptual horizons, Socratic follow-ups.
    3. **Stage 3: Taking the Lead (Independent Deep Learning)**:
       * *Pedagogical Focus*: Student-led creation, active collaboration, project-driven learning.
       * *Instructional Style*: Collaborative partner-level dialogue, real-world application, peer review prep.

    ## Fine-tuning and Dataset Construction
    When constructing SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) datasets for Shri:
    * **Teacher-Student Distillation**: Generate structured question-answer pairs that utilize high-fidelity teacher models (e.g., Llama-3-Nemotron) to capture maternal Socratic prompting styles.
    * **Socratic Prompt Design**: Never present a direct answer immediately; instead, formulate supportive questions that guide the child to discover the truth within themselves.
