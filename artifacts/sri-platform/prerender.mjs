/**
 * prerender.mjs
 * Post-build static pre-rendering for SEO.
 *
 * Run after `vite build`. For each public marketing route:
 *   1. Injects per-route <title>, <meta>, <link rel="canonical"> into <head>
 *   2. Adds a visually-hidden static content block (<h1> + body text) into <body>
 *      that is readable by Googlebot and AI crawlers but hidden from sighted users.
 *   3. Writes dist/public/{route}/index.html so the static server serves the
 *      correct pre-rendered HTML for each URL path without any server-side logic.
 *
 * The SPA still hydrates normally — React replaces #root content; the static
 * SEO block lives outside #root and persists invisibly after hydration.
